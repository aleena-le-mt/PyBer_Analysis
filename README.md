# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
You have been assigned to analyze all rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to create a visualization for PyBer in order to help improve the access to ride-sharing services & determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

1. Rural Cities have an average of around 34.62 fare per ride & an average of approximately 8.06 fare per driver.
2. Suburban Cities have an average of around 30.97 fare per ride & an average of approximately 2.26 fare per driver.
3. Urban Cities have an average of around 24.53 fare per ride & an average of approximately 0.67 fare per driver.

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv
               ride_data.csv
               PyBer_ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
### The Summary DataFrame shows that:
#### The city types are:
- Rural
- Suburban
- Urban
### The city results:
#### Rural Cities
        - 125 Total Rides
        - 537 Total Drivers
        - An average of around 34.62 fare per ride
        - An average of approximately 8.06 fare per driver.
#### Suburban Cities
        - 625 Total Rides
        - 8570 Total Drivers
        - An average of around 30.97 fare per ride
        - An average of approximately 2.26 fare per driver.
#### Urban Cities
        - 1625 Total Rides
        - 59602 Total Drivers
        - An average of around 24.53 fare per ride 
        - An average of approximately 0.67 fare per driver.
#### The city type with the most fare on average for rides and drivers:
    Rural cities, with 34.62 on average fare per ride and 8.06 on average fare per driver.
      
## Challenge Overview
According to the dataframe, we have data on the total rides, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. It shows that rural cities tend to pay the most fares for rides and has the least total rides. Urban cities pay the least fares for these rides and has the most total rides. Suburban cities are however in the middle compared to rural and urban cities.

## Challenge Summary
For this challenge, the dataframes that I was making became much clearer to read compared to the last try. Even if this is the case, the average fare per driver did not match up with the dataframe shown in the module. I am completely fine with handing in what I have now as my final product for this module although I would like to know what to do to fix this too. Other than that, I feel much better after working on this since this time I got help from a tutor.
