# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
You have been assigned to analyze all rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to create a visualization for PyBer in order to help improve the access to ride-sharing services & determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

1. Rural Cities have an average of around 40 fare per ride & an average of approximately 5.7 fare per driver.
2. Suburban Cities have an average of around 436 fare per ride & an average of approximately 3.3 fare per driver.
3. Urban Cities have an average of around 24.64 fare per ride & an average of approximately 2.05 fare per driver.
4. The city type with the most fare:
      -Rural cities

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv
               ride_data.csv
               PyBer_ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
The Summary DataFrame shows that:
- The city types are:
      - Rural
      - Suburban
      - Urban
- The city results:
      * Rural Cities
        - 10 Total Rides
        - 70 Total Drivers
        - An average of around 40 fare per ride
        - An average of approximately 5.7 fare per driver.
      * Suburban Cities
        - 16 Total Rides
        - 176 Total Drivers
        - An average of around 436 fare per ride
        - An average of approximately 3.3 fare per driver.
       * Urban Cities
        - 18 Total Rides
        - 216 Total Drivers
        - An average of around 24.64 fare per ride 
        - An average of approximately 2.05 fare per driver.
-The city type with the most fare on average for rides and drivers:
      -Rural cities, with 40 on average fare per ride and 5.7 on average fare per driver.
      
## Challenge Overview
According to the data that we have so far, it is quite hard to find what we need to look at. The dataframe shows the total rides, total drivers, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. It is said that in rural cities, the total rides is 10, the total drivers is 70, the average fare per ride is approximately 40, and the average fare per driver is around 5.72.

## Challenge Summary
For this challenge, the dataframes that I was making did not match with the example dataframe so I have been trying to figure that out for many days now, but no matter how much I try on my own to figure out where I went wrong, I was still that at the same place and am not making any progress. With that said, I think I am just going to hand in what I have for now for more future information on where I went wrong and what I should do in order to get the right data frame. I feel like as long as I figure out how my data frame should be, then I will be able to continue and finish this completely without any flaws.
